What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, an empty directory .git is created.
	This directory is a hidden from the user.
	
	We need to initialize a repository, so that it allows git to keep record of all the 
	files that we added to the repository and the changes that we have made to these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory contains all the files, whereas a staging area is just a
	place holder which contains only the files that needs to be added or linked
	together for a single commit before actually including in the repository.

	Repository contains details of all the changes made till date, but staging area
	contains only the current changes that are to be included into the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
